# FMT

Forest Monitoring Tool is an online platform for monitoring and responding to forest using near real-time information. FMT empowers people to better control the forest before the forest turns into a desert and hold accountable those who may be responsible. 

The forest managers and operators will subscribe to the system in order to receive forest degradation alerts at the time of occurrence. The system will allow forest operators to apply for certain activities to be done on a particular plantation. These activities could be weeding, pruning and harvesting. The system will make sure that the operators are doing these activities on the specified area that is indicated on the license. 

In addition, the system will connect to the satellite and provide data access and also receive image updates from the satellite. The imagery data will be decoded into meaningful information according to the color codes provided by the system administrator. This will help the forest managers to take initiative action depending on the color code that has been incurred. 

They system will allow forest managers to designate areas of interest to be monitored. The forest managers will select an area that they want the system to monitor.  After selection, the system will provide information to the forest managers according to the selected area. Alerts will be distributed only from the areas that the forest managers have selected.
